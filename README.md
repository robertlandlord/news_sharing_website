###Our Creative Portion
We're very excited to present the following features:
- User Page: When a user is logged in, they will see a button towards the top of the main page that reads "User Page." This displays all of the users stories and comments, and lets them delete or edit any of them (they may also view their stories from this page). The User Page also features another creative addition, Password Change.
- Password Change: This feature, located in a button on a user's User Page, allows them to change their password if they so desire. The user is prompted to enter their old password and then enter their new password twice, to avoid typos.
- Search Bar: This final feature is available at the very top of the main page for account-having users and lurkers alike. The user may enter a search string, and they will be redirected to a page featuring all articles with that string in the title.

###Login Info:
There is a new account with username: newbubby, password: bubster. However you are free to create your own!
